# RFSS
NOAA - RF Survey System 

This code is intended to be run on the RF Survey System (RFSS) located at different earth stations to evaluate RF Interference (RFI) anomolies that may exist in the environment prior to and during a meteorological satellite pass.  

Instruments for automation include the R&S FSV3000 Spectrum Analyzer configured for both Spectrum and IQ sweeps to measure prior to and during a satellite pass.
